        "The art of healing comes from nature and not from the physician. 
        Therefore, the physician must start from nature with an open mind."</br>
        </br>
        "The dose makes the poison."</br>
        </br>
        "All that man needs for health and healing has been provided by God in nature, the Challenge of science is to find it."

          For thousands of years the herbalist and the apothecary kept their people healthy; They healed their wounds and cured their
          ailments. They weren't perfect, and modern science has definitely made leaps and bounds in our understanding of the
          world we live in. But there are trends in modern medical care that seem to be taking us down a path that has no place
          for our natural world.</br>
          </br>
          I believe that is a grave mistake. There are so many things that can be cured - easily at times, with the proper
          application of natural remedies. They are often much easier on our bodies as well. You just need to be open to trying
          something new.</br>

          This site, and it's accompanying blog, documents my journey into this fascinating world.
