            “Homeopathy cures a larger percentage of cases than any other form of treatment and is beyond doubt safer and more economical.” -

            "I also turn to homeopathic remedies for the treatment of indigestion, travel sickness, insomnia and hay fever just to name a few. 
            Homeopathy offers a safe, natural alternative that causes no side effects or drug interactions." -

              I started this absorbing journey to see if I could assist my family with some of the chronic issues they were having. A lot of 
              research later... I have realized how much there is to know, and how very effective it can be.

              There is so much fantastic information online it's easy to get lost. It's also sometimes difficult to gain specific knowledge, usually 
              because many of the websites that have information are also trying to sell you their teas, tinctures etc. Their private blends are  
              too valuable to give away. Which makes sense. But I'm not doing this to sell anything. I'm doing this to spread the message.
